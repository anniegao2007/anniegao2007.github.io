## About
Annie is a carillonist and software engineer from the sunny suburbs of Southern California. She began her carillon studies in the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs, where she took lessons from Ellen Dickinson and was Co-Chair in her final year. She completed her GCNA Carillonneur exam in 2020, and graduated from Yale in May 2021 with a combined B.S./M.S. in Computer Science. She then had the tremendous privilege of continuing her carillon studies in Europe and the US, studying under Geert D'hollander, Boudewijn Zwart, and Eddy Marien. In her free time, Annie enjoys competitive ping pong, puzzles and brainteasers, good reads, and opportunities to explore and improve her fascinatingly bad sense of direction.
